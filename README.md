# This is a game I am making in my spare time while refining my coding skills alongside building new development skillsets.

## The resources and assets are either license free or generated images with alterations made.



### This project was started at the tale end of CS-330, I have gained enough confidence that I could create something in more up to date engine vs having to manually set everything via a coordinate system as I was doing in the class with OpenGL. 
### This is a rough version and the primary structure of something I will refine and release once I am able to create the music and sound effects.
### The game has a rough targeting system and an enemy spawner, alongside a shooting mechanic (auto).
